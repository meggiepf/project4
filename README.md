# Overview: 
  Weâ€™ll be using existing credit loan data from Lending Club to train a model to predict if a loan candidate will be likely to repay the loan. 

  Our target value will be loan grade, which is  a classification system that assigns a quality score to a loan application to identify a risk of default. 
  
# Project Outline: 
Use Lending Club Loan Data to create decision tree predictive model

Create, implement, and optimize a predictive model using:

Python Pandas

Sklearn

Python Matplotlib

Utilize HTML/CSS/Bootstrap to create a webpage to display visualizations and loan prediction app
